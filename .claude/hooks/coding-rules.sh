# JustDummies — coding-rules hook.
#
# Wired from .claude/settings.json on PostToolUse for the file-editing tools, so
# an agent learns it broke a coding rule at the moment it wrote the file — not
# once CI is red, and not once a human is reading the diff.
#
# Why a hook and not just a written rule. This repository's style has always been
# recorded in JustDummies.sln.DotSettings, which Rider reads and nothing else
# can: no compiler, no CI job, and no agent. CLAUDE.md used to delegate to that
# file ("follow it"), which reads like an instruction but is not one for a reader
# that cannot open it. The explicit-type rule drifted to 203 violations under that
# arrangement. The rules an agent must follow are now written out in CLAUDE.md
# ("Coding rules"), and this hook is what makes them observable rather than
# merely stated (ADR-0056).
#
# It complements, and does not replace, the build-time enforcement: .editorconfig
# plus EnforceCodeStyleInBuild report the same explicit-type rule as IDE0008, which
# CI turns into an error (ADR-0055). That gate is authoritative but late — it fires
# only when someone builds. This hook fires on the edit itself.
#
# The hook never rewrites anything: it reads the file that was just written and
# reports. Fixing is the agent's job, which keeps the agent's own output the thing
# under correction rather than something a formatter quietly patched behind it.
#
# Adding a rule. Write a `rule_<name>` function that prints one line per offence
# (empty output means clean), then add it to RULES below. Every rule must be a
# pure read of the edited file and cost milliseconds: this runs after every single
# edit. Anything needing a build or a solution-wide analysis belongs in CI, not
# here.
