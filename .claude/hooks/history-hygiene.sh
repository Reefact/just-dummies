# JustDummies — history-hygiene hook.
#
# Wired from .claude/settings.json on two events so an agent never opens a pull
# request on — nor quietly grows — a branch whose commits would land messy in
# `main`. This repository lands pull requests by rebase (ADR-0051), so every
# commit on a branch is replayed into protected history (CONTRIBUTING.md,
# "Branches"): a messy history is not squashed away on merge, and no merge
# commit brackets it either — it stays on `main` for good.
#
# It reuses the repository's single commit linter
# (tools/commit-lint/lint-commit-message.sh), so the hook, the local commit-msg
# hook and the CI gate can never disagree about what a conforming header is.
#
# Modes (argument 1):
#   pre-pr       PreToolUse on the pull-request-creation tool. BLOCKS (exit 2)
#                only when the branch carries CI-fatal history — pending
#                fixup!/squash!/amend! placeholders, or headers the linter
#                rejects — because that pull request would fail the commit-lint
#                CI job and cannot merge as-is. Softer mess (wip-ish commits
#                whose headers each lint clean) is left to the agent's judgement
#                (AGENTS.md); the hook does not block on taste.
#   post-commit  PostToolUse on Bash. After a git command that moved the branch
#                tip and left origin/main..HEAD messy, prints an advisory
#                reminder (exit 2 surfaces it to the agent; nothing is blocked,
#                the tool already ran).
#
# The hook never rewrites anything: it only reads and reminds. The judgement of
# "is this messy?" and the decision to rewrite stay with the agent and, for the
# rewrite itself, the maintainer.

Per AGENTS.md ("Tidying history before a pull request"): propose a cleanup and,
once the maintainer approves, run /tidy-history — autosquash the placeholders,
reword the non-conforming headers — while the branch is yours alone, publishing
with 'git push --force-with-lease'. Then retry.
