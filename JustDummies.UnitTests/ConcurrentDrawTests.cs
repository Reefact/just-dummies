///     Drawing from one seeded source on several threads at once. The ambient source flows with the execution
///     context, so it reaches every thread a test spawns; a context from <see cref="Dummy.WithSeed" /> is shared by
///     whoever holds it. Both therefore hand the same source to concurrent callers, and the source must survive it.

///         Regression for issue #310. The defect was not a loss of quality but a collapse: an unsynchronized
///         <see cref="Random" /> whose two internal indices converge under contention returns zero for ever, so every
///         generator settles on the minimum of its declared range — <c>0</c>, <c>""</c>, <see cref="Guid.Empty" />,
///         <see cref="int.MinValue" /> — and stays there for the rest of the scope. Those are exactly the values most
///         likely to make an assertion pass for the wrong reason, and nothing throws.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         These tests are statistical in the direction that matters least: once the draw is serialized, corruption is
///         impossible rather than unlikely, so they pass deterministically. Before the fix they failed with very high
///         probability but not certainty — the usual bargain for a concurrency regression. The parallelism is
///         deliberately oversubscribed relative to the core count to make the contention reliable.
