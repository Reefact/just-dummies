///             A predefined type is written with its C# keyword (<c>string</c>, <c>int</c>), never with its CLR
///             name (<c>String</c>, <c>Int32</c>). Both bind to the same documentation ID, so the generated XML
///             is identical either way and the deviation drifts in unnoticed. It costs the source, not the
///             package: inside <see cref="Any" /> a generic argument written <c>Action{String}</c> reads as the
///             <see cref="Any.String" /> factory rather than as the CLR string.
///         </item>
///         <item>
///             Inside the two types that host the type-named factories, a cref meaning the BCL type is qualified
///             with its namespace. A cref carrying no parameter list accepts a method as a target, so a bare
///             <c>DateTime</c> written there binds to the factory instead of the type. Unlike the first rule this
///             one is not cosmetic: the wrong target ships resolved in the package XML, and every reader follows
///             it. Write <c>Any.DateTime</c> when the factory really is what is meant.
///         </item>
///     </list>
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The first rule is a text scan, not reflection: by the time a cref reaches the generated XML the compiler
///     has resolved it to <c>System.String</c> and the spelling under test no longer exists. Reading the sources
///     of the sibling projects creates no assembly reference, so the standalone boundary
///     <c>ArchitectureTests</c> guards is untouched.
