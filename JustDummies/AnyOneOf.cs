/// <summary>
///     A generator that draws an arbitrary value from an <b>explicit, fixed pool</b> supplied by the caller — the
///     dummy for a value whose domain is a closed set a test does not assert on (one of the currencies a context is
///     configured with, one of the orders already in a fixture, one of a handful of domain states). Unlike the typed
///     builders' <c>OneOf</c>, which narrows <i>within</i> a scalar's own domain, this draws from values the library
///     could never synthesize on its own. It still composes like any other generator — pipe it through <c>As(...)</c>
///     into a value object, make it optional with <c>OrNull()</c>, or fold it into <c>Combine(...)</c> and the
///     collection generators.

///     <para>
///         Each <see cref="Generate" /> draws one value uniformly from the pool, from the generator's random context —
///         so a run is reproducible under a seed, exactly like every other generator. Duplicate values are collapsed
///         under <see cref="EqualityComparer{T}.Default" />, so no value carries a heavier weight for being listed
///         twice, and the number of distinct values is the exact size of the domain a distinct collection
///         (<c>SetOf</c>, a dictionary's keys) gates against.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The pool is the whole <i>shape</i> of the specification: <typeparamref name="T" /> is opaque to the
///         library, so there is no type-specific constraint to offer. What it does expose is the type-agnostic
///         exclusion pair <see cref="Except" />/<see cref="DifferentFrom" />, which every other generator carries —
///         they remove values from the pool rather than describing a shape, and removing everything is a
///         <see cref="ConflictingAnyConstraintException" /> at declaration, like any other emptied domain.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A <c>null</c> element is rejected at construction: nullability is an orthogonal concern expressed by
///         <c>OrNull()</c>, never smuggled into the pool.
