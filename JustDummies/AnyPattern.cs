/// <summary>
///     A generator of arbitrary strings that <b>match a regular expression</b> — the dummy for a value whose format is
///     defined by a pattern (an order reference, a SKU, a currency code). The pattern is the whole <i>shape</i> of the
///     specification: unlike <see cref="AnyString" /> this generator exposes no further shape or length constraints —
///     express those inside the pattern instead. What it does expose is the exclusion pair <see cref="Except" /> and
///     <see cref="DifferentFrom" />, which every other generator carries. It also composes like any other generator:
///     pipe it through <c>As(...)</c> into a value object, make it optional with <c>OrNull()</c>, or fold it into
///     <c>Combine(...)</c> and the collection generators.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The pattern is parsed once, when the generator is created; each <see cref="Generate" /> then walks the
///         parsed tree, drawing every choice and repetition count from the generator's random context — so a run is
///         reproducible under a seed, exactly like every other generator. Wherever the pattern leaves a character
///         free, values are drawn from <b>printable ASCII</b> (<c>\s</c> may also yield a tab); a character the pattern
///         names explicitly is emitted as written, control characters included. Values are built directly rather than
///         generated-and-filtered.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A built value is then checked against the real .NET engine and, on the rare miss, redrawn. The structural
///         build mirrors the regular subset of the engine, but a few implementation-defined corners of empty-match
///         handling — a nullable alternative under a quantifier, whose emptiness the engine accepts or refuses
///         depending on branch order and form — cannot be mirrored structurally. Rather than model those corners, the
///         invariant "a generated value matches its pattern" is kept by construction: the check is the last word, so a
///         value the engine would reject is never returned.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         A shape constraint is refused because it would mean building a value in the intersection of two regular
///         languages, which the library has no machinery for. An <b>exclusion</b> asks for nothing of the sort: it
///         never constructs, it rejects. The value is built from the pattern exactly as before and redrawn on a hit —
///         one more predicate inside a loop that already turns. That places it under the exception the library already
///         documents for strings: with no ordinal mapping to build the exclusion into, it is met by a <b>bounded</b>
///         redraw, so an exclusion tight enough to leave nothing surfaces at <see cref="Generate" /> as a seed-bearing
///         <see cref="AnyGenerationException" /> rather than eagerly at declaration.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Only the <b>regular</b> subset of the pattern language is supported (see <see cref="Any.StringMatching(string)" />);
///         a non-regular construct is refused eagerly with an <see cref="UnsupportedRegexException" /> rather than
///         silently mis-generated.
///     </para>
///     <example>
///         <code>
///         string reference = Any.StringMatching(@"^ORD-\d{8}$").Generate();
///         string other     = Any.StringMatching(@"^ORD-\d{8}$").DifferentFrom(existing).Generate();
///         IAny&lt;OrderReference&gt; any = Any.StringMatching(@"^ORD-\d{8}$").As(OrderReference.Create);
