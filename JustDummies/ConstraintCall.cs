///     A constraint as the caller spelled it — the declaring method's name and what it was given — rendered into the
///     form the diagnostics quote back: <c>Zero()</c>, <c>Between(0, 100)</c>, <c>OneOf(...)</c>. It is the unit a
///     conflict message names, so the punctuation that makes a constraint read as a call is written here once
///     instead of at every site that declares one.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         The two factories are the two things a generator can say about a constraint's arguments: it can render
///         them — none at all being the ordinary case of <see cref="Of" /> called with no argument — or it cannot,
///         and <see cref="OfElided" /> stands in for them. The second is a claim, not a shortcut: a pool of an
///         opaque <c>T</c> has arguments the library must <b>not</b> render, because their <c>ToString</c> belongs
///         to the caller and could be anything.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The rendering happens once, in the constructor, and <see cref="ToString" /> only reads it back. That is
///         deliberate rather than an optimization: a constraint is quoted while a
///         <see cref="ConflictingDummyConstraintException" /> is being built, and building an exception must never
///         throw (ADR-0024). Rendering when the constraint is declared — on the path that succeeds — leaves nothing
///         on the failing path that could fail in its turn.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Pass the name as <c>nameof(...)</c>. It ties the message to the API it names, so renaming the method
///         carries its diagnostics along, and a misspelling stops being a string literal that compiles.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Two constraints are equal when they read the same, ordinally. That is not a convenience: a spec compares
///         the constraint being applied against the one it already recorded to tell a harmless redeclaration
///         (<c>Between(0, 100)</c> twice, which returns the spec untouched) from a real conflict
///         (<c>Between(0, 100)</c> then <c>Between(5, 50)</c>). <c>==</c> is defined for the same reason rather
///         than for symmetry — those comparisons are written with it, and a reference type without it would compare
///         identities in silence, turning every redeclaration into a conflict.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Nothing checks the rendered arguments for <c>null</c>, and that is the compiler's job rather than an
///         omission: the parameter is a non-nullable <c>string[]</c>, so a caller that cannot prove an argument
///         non-null is CS8604 at build time, which this repository promotes to an error. A runtime guard would only
///         restate it, and could not be reached from C# without defeating the annotation it duplicates.
