///     A blamed subject and what it claims about the values it admits — <c>WithLength(3)</c> paired with "already
///     fixes the length at 3". The pair exists so a conflict can be reported against whichever of two subjects is
///     not the one being applied, without the reporting code taking four loose strings in an order nothing checks.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Immutable, and a class rather than a struct, like every value in this repository: a struct would expose a
///     parameterless constructor yielding a pair with no name and no claim.
///     <para>
///         The subject is usually a constraint the caller wrote, and <see cref="Of" /> takes it as one. It is not
///         always: a shape's part can be blamed too — the contained value <c>"ABC"</c>, the prefix <c>"ORD-"</c> —
///         and those are phrases the library composes, not calls anyone made. <see cref="OfPhrase" /> is that case,
///         named rather than smuggled through as a string, so the constraint slot keeps meaning a constraint. A
///         phrase carries no <see cref="Constraint" />, which is what makes it never equal to the constraint being
///         applied — the comparison the blame choice turns on.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Two claims are equal when they blame the same subject for the same thing. Being a value with no identity
///         beyond what it holds, it says so rather than leaving the reference comparison a reader would get by
///         default — the same reason <see cref="ConstraintCall" /> carries its own (ADR-0042). Nothing compares two
///         claims today; a value that answers the question wrongly the first time it is asked is worse than one that
///         answers it, so the answer is written now rather than when a caller needs it.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         It carries no argument guard, and says so with <see cref="BuiltOnTheFailurePathAttribute" />: instances are
///         built at a throw site, as an argument to an exception factory, so a guard here would throw while a failure
///         is being reported and lose it (ADR-0041). The contract is the compiler's — the members are non-nullable
///         where a value is required, so a caller that cannot prove one is <c>CS8604</c> at build time. Comparing and
///         hashing stay on that footing: neither composes anything, so neither can fail while a failure is reported.
