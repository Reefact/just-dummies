///     The immutable count specification shared by every collection generator (<see cref="AnyList{T}" />,
///     <see cref="AnySet{T}" />, ...): a lower bound, an optional upper bound and an optional exact count — each
///     remembering the constraint that set it, so a conflict message can name both sides. It is the collection-count
///     analogue of <see cref="StringSpec" />'s length bounds: every mutation returns a new specification and
///     cross-validates the whole eagerly, so a collection generator that exists can always produce a count.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Unconstrained, a collection draws between <c>0</c> and <see cref="DefaultCountSpread" /> elements: an
///     unconstrained collection can therefore be empty — chain <c>NonEmpty()</c> when the surrounding code requires
///     content. The spread is deliberately smaller than <see cref="AnyString" />'s (which is 16): a collection's
///     elements are themselves generated values, heavier than a string's characters, so a smaller default keeps a
///     dummy collection cheap while still exercising the multi-element path.
///     <para>
///         That spread governs every draw, bounded or not (ADR-0029): a declared maximum composes with it rather than
///         replacing it, so an upper bound only narrows the draw and never widens it. Only a minimum, an exact count
///         or required elements enlarge a collection.
