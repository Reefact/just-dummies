///     The magnitude an arbitrary number stays within unless a declared constraint leaves no room for it — the

/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         A dummy exists to fill a slot whose content the test does not care about. A value drawn uniformly across a
///         floating-point type's whole domain is not that: almost every draw lands within a few decades of the
///         type's maximum, where the type stops behaving like arithmetic — a further multiplication overflows,
///         <c>x + 1 == x</c>, and a scale constraint has no fractional digits left to constrain. Such a value makes
///         the test fail for reasons that have nothing to do with what it asserts, and never visits the magnitudes
///         where real defects live.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The window <b>clips</b> a draw; it never widens one, and it never overrides a declared bound. A generator
///         whose declared interval lies entirely outside it — <c>Between(1e300, 1e308)</c> — draws from that interval
///         as declared, because the caller asked for that magnitude explicitly. A generator whose declared interval
///         merely <i>permits</i> large values — <c>Between(0, double.MaxValue)</c> — keeps drawing ordinary ones,
///         because permitting is not requesting. Sizes drew the same distinction once (ADR-0029): a declared bound
///         narrowed a produced size and never widened it. ADR-0075 moved that policy — a declared maximum now
///         steers a size draw and can widen it well past the default spread — so this window's own "clip, never
///         widen" rule is a numeric-only invariant now, not one this codebase applies uniformly to every kind of
///         bound.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Both constants carry the same magnitude in the two arithmetics the numeric engines use. A type whose whole
///         domain is already ordinary — <c>Half</c>, which stops at 65 504 — is unaffected, since clipping to a
///         window wider than its domain changes nothing.
