///     What a failed draw needs in order to be replayed: the seed of the run, and the sentence telling the reader how
///     to use it. The two are always derived from the same source and always travel together, so they are one value
///     rather than two arguments that a call site could pair wrongly.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     A class rather than a struct, like every value object here: a struct carries a parameterless constructor that
///     would yield a seedless, guidance-less instance bypassing the factories below.
///     <para>
///         Two replays are equal when they replay the same run the same way — the seed alone does not settle it,
///         since the same seed replays a run in full or only in part depending on what drew. Being a value with no
///         identity beyond what it holds, it says so rather than leaving the reference comparison a reader would get
///         by default (ADR-0042).
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Built while a failure is being reported, so it guards nothing (ADR-0041): a guard on this path would throw
///         while a failure is being reported and lose the original. Its parameters are non-nullable instead, which
///         makes the contract the compiler's. Comparing and hashing keep that footing: neither composes anything, so
///         neither can fail while a failure is reported.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         The seed is <b>supplied</b> rather than read back from the source, because the two are not always the same
///         thing: <see cref="RandomSource.Current" /> on the ambient source creates a state — and a fresh seed — when
///         none exists, so a caller that drew with a seed captured earlier must hand that seed over rather than let it
///         be resolved a second time.
///     </para>
