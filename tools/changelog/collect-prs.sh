#!/bin/sh
# Collect the merged pull requests that belong to ONE release train (lib, cli or
# dum) and emit them as slim JSON on stdout, for the changelog drafter to summarise.
#
# The train partition mirrors tools/packaging/release-notes.sh EXACTLY — by the
# Conventional Commit scope carried by a pull request's own commits, not by
# labels or by the pull request title:
#   lib   -> scopes core, analyzers (JustDummies, analyzers bundled in)
#   cli -> scopes cli, gendoc                      (the fce tool: CLI + GenDoc + worker)
#   dum -> scope justdummies                           (the standalone JustDummies library)
# A pull request is kept when at least one of its commits carries a scope in the
# train's set. Pull requests whose commits are all scopeless infrastructure
# (bare `ci:` / `chore:` / `docs:` ...) belong to neither train and are dropped —
# the same rule release-notes.sh applies to commits, so the human-facing changelog
# and the generated GitHub Release notes describe the same set of changes.
#
# Usage: tools/changelog/collect-prs.sh <lib|cli|dum>
#   Reads the optional environment variable FROM_REF: the previous tag whose merge
#   time bounds the range. When empty, the train's latest tag is used; when there
#   is none either (the train's first release), the whole history is taken.
#   Needs `gh` authenticated (GH_TOKEN in the environment) and a full checkout
#   (actions/checkout with fetch-depth: 0) so the tag timestamp resolves.
#
# Output: a JSON array [{number,title,body,labels:[name],author}] — possibly [].
