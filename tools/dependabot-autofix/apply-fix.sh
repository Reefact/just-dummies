# Apply the model's chosen repair to a Dependabot pull request and push it.
#
# Usage: tools/dependabot-autofix/apply-fix.sh <pr-number> <head-branch> <verdict-json> <workdir>
#   <workdir> is a SEPARATE checkout of the pull request's head branch (the
#   workflow checks it out with a push-capable token; the scripts themselves come
#   from the base checkout). Only git operations happen here — apply / reword /
#   rebase / push — never a build. The bumped dependency's code is therefore never
#   executed with the write token; the pushed commit is validated by the ordinary
#   ci run in its read-only Dependabot context.
#
# Env: GH_TOKEN (for `gh pr edit`), GITHUB_REPOSITORY, and GITHUB_OUTPUT to report
# the outcome back to the step. Best-effort: any action that cannot be applied
# cleanly leaves the pull request untouched and reports a skip reason, so the
# workflow falls back to an advisory comment rather than pushing a broken change.
