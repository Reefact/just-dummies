# Generate GitHub Release notes for ONE release train (lib, cli or dum), containing only the
# commits that belong to that train — so a lib release never lists cli work, and vice versa.
#
# The partition is by Conventional Commit scope (enforced by tools/commit-lint):
#   lib   -> scopes core, analyzers (JustDummies, analyzers bundled in)
#   cli -> scopes cli, gendoc                      (the fce tool: CLI + GenDoc + worker)
#   dum -> scope justdummies                           (the standalone JustDummies library)
# Commits with no scope (bare `ci:`, `build:`, `chore:` ...) are infrastructure and are left out
# of both trains: these notes describe what changed for the consumer of the package, nothing else.
#
# Usage: tools/packaging/release-notes.sh <scope:lib|cli|dum> <current-tag> [<end-ref>]
#   Emits Markdown on stdout. Needs full history + tags in the checkout (actions/checkout with
#   fetch-depth: 0) so the previous same-train tag — the lower bound of the range — resolves. <end-ref>
#   is the upper bound and defaults to <current-tag>; pass the release commit when the tag does not exist
#   yet (a workflow_dispatch publish creates the tag only after the notes are built).
