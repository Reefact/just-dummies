# Read the SonarCloud Quality Gate verdict for this project and fail when it is not green.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/sonar-profile/check-gate.sh
#
# Why this exists. `dotnet-sonarscanner end` uploads the analysis and returns; it neither waits
# for the gate nor reads it, and no GitHub check carries the verdict. The gate was therefore
# computed and enforced by nothing, while the workflow that produced it stayed green as long as
# the upload succeeded.
#
# Why here and not in the sonar workflow. Making the scanner wait would couple MERGE
# AVAILABILITY to a third-party service: the sonar job is a required check, so a SonarCloud
# outage would stop every merge while a red gate still would not. Reading the verdict from a
# SCHEDULED job separates the two — the verdict is enforced, and an outage costs a red nightly
# instead of a frozen repository (decision: ADR-0062, follow-up on the gate questions).
#
# What this catches that the build cannot. build/sonar-profile.globalconfig enforces the C# rules
# the NuGet analyzer implements, and that is a strict subset of what the gate measures:
#   - symbolic-execution rules (S2583 and its family) that SonarCloud's engine runs and the
#     analyzer package does not — measured: a violation of S2583 sat in this repository with the
#     rule enforced at `warning` and the local build reported nothing;
#   - every non-C# rule family: githubactions, shell, secrets, xml, json, yaml;
#   - coverage, duplication and security-hotspot review, which no analyzer can answer.
# Those are the classes that actually turn this gate red, so the build hardening and this check
# are complements, not alternatives.
#
# The project is public, so no token is required; SONAR_TOKEN is honoured when set.
