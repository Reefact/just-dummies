# Regenerate build/sonar-profile.globalconfig from the project's SonarCloud C# Quality Profile.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/sonar-profile/sync-profile.sh            rewrite the file in place
#   tools/sonar-profile/sync-profile.sh --check    exit 1 if it would change, and print the diff
#
# Why this exists. The SonarAnalyzer.CSharp NuGet package does NOT ship the Quality Profile:
# measured, its default set leaves S3776 and S1192 disabled although the profile activates
# them. The profile lives on the server and is the thing the report is scored against, so the
# only way the build can agree with the report is to read the profile and write it down. This
# script is that reading; the generated file is that writing.
#
# The default is ENFORCE. Every rule the profile activates is written at `warning`, which the CI
# ratchet in Directory.Build.props promotes to an error. That direction is deliberate and was
# chosen after measuring the alternative: at `suggestion`, a Sonar diagnostic prints NOTHING in
# `dotnet build` at any verbosity — it reaches an IDE and the SARIF log and nobody else — so a
# generated list at `suggestion` would have been invisible to exactly the reader it was for.
#
# The exceptions are written by hand in .editorconfig, which takes precedence over a global
# AnalyzerConfig (verified in both directions). A rule with existing violations is demoted there
# to `suggestion`, with its site count, until they are cleared; a rule this codebase refuses is
# set to `none` with its reason. That list is the backlog, and it shrinks by deletion.
#
# Fails closed, three ways. An empty or short answer aborts without touching the file, so one API
# hiccup cannot rewrite the rule set. A project key that disagrees with sonar.yml aborts, because
# validating the wrong project would pass in green forever. And a count that disagrees with the
# profile's own activeRuleCount is reported loudly rather than accepted in silence.
