# Single source of truth for the release trains.
#
# The published trains version independently and each owns a tag prefix, a set
# of Conventional Commit scopes, a NuGet package label, and a changelog file. That
# mapping used to be copied verbatim into tools/packaging/release-notes.sh and
# tools/changelog/collect-prs.sh; it now lives here, once. The scripts and the
# changelog workflow *source* this file, so the partition can never drift between
# "what a release publishes" and "what the changelog documents".
#
# This file is meant to be SOURCED (`. tools/trains.sh`), not executed — it only
# defines functions and mutates nothing.
#
# ── History ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# In Reefact/first-class-errors this product rode a single `dum` train (dum-v*)
# that published JustDummies and JustDummies.Xunit together, because the adapter
# versions with the library it adapts. No dum-v* tag was ever pushed before the
# extraction, so renaming the trains here discarded no published version.
#
# The adapter now has its own train, and it is genuinely its own (ADR-0047).
#
# It did not start that way. JustDummies.Xunit carries a ProjectReference on
# JustDummies, and `dotnet pack` declares such a dependency at the version the
# referenced project was BUILT with — which the release scripts set globally, so
# the adapter demanded its own version of the library. An adapter-only fix could
# not ship as xunit-v0.1.1 until a lib-v0.1.1 existed: independent in name,
# locked in fact. pack.sh now CHOOSES that dependency, as the newest published
# lib-v* tag, so the two trains move separately.
#
# The guard in tools/packaging/pack.sh stays: the declared dependency must still
# match a lib-v* tag, because publishing one that matches none is NU1102 for the
# consumer, on an immutable artifact. It verifies a decision now instead of
# catching an accident.
#
# ── Adding a train ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Add one row to trains_rows() below, then make the static edits GitHub forces
# (tag trigger, choice options, commit-lint scopes, packaging). The full checklist
# is doc/handwritten/for-maintainers/AddingAReleaseTrain.en.md.
#
# Row format (pipe-separated, no spaces around the pipes except inside the label):
#   <id>|<tag-prefix>|<scopes csv>|<changelog file>|<package label>
#
# Scopes a train claims are normally a subset of the closed list in
# tools/commit-lint/lint-commit-message.sh, with ONE deliberate exception: `lib` also
# claims `dummies` and `justdummies`. Those are what this product's commits carried for
# its whole life in Reefact/first-class-errors -- 207 of them -- and the partition has to
# describe the history as it was written, not as it would be written today. Without them
# the first release notes list four commits out of two hundred. New commits still cannot
# use them: commit-lint is a separate file and rejects both.
